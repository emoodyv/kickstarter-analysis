# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This research is at the behest of a play writer named Louise. She launched a campaign on Kickstarter for her play named Fever. So far that campaign has come close to its fundraising goal. Therefore, Louise wants to use data analytics in order to explore the correlation between successful projects and factors such as lunch date and fundraising goal.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze a plethora of Kickstarter projects in order to observe how well theater play fundraising campaigns fared. 

## Analysis Overview
Towards the goal of exploring the correlation between successful projects and factors such as lunch date and fundraising goal this endeavor obtained data from 4114 Kickstarter projects. Here are a few examples of what that data looked like:

In order to come to any conclusions with this data it was filtered, sorted, and parsed by multiple factors derived from the data. These included the project goal, amount pledged, outcome of the campaign, when the campaign was launched (more importantly the month it was stated), how many backers the campaign had, the parent category, subcategory, and the percentage it was funded. With all these factors several conclusions were able to be made.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One of the important conclusions that needed to be deciphered and made was how campaigns fared with respect to their month of inception. To that end, a pivot chart was created with the 4114 campaigns being filtered by the parent category and the month created. Note that for the purposes of Louise’s data aspirations the data was filtered to only include theater campaigns. Below is the resultant data:

From this data a conclusion was able to be reached.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Much like the need to analyze the data based on the start data it was important to Louise that the Kickstarter data be investigated based on the campaign’s original goal. Accordingly, the only campaigns scrutinized were the those with the subcategory of theater plays. From there excel was used to count the amount and percentage of projects that succeeded, failed, and were canceled. These tallies were then put in perspective of the original goal that the project had. Below is the table that was generated:

Not dissimilar to the previous analysis, this data is able to gift us with a conclusion.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As with any technical project the biggest hurdle is to harness and correctly apply the technology being used. This project is no exception. Problems that could be encountered would be not understanding excel, mastering excel’s complexities, or correctly setting and formatting the repository on GitHub. These and many more challenges could hinder the completion of this project.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The data acquired from the analysis of the campaign outcome based on the launch data shows us two important points. Firstly, the best month to start a campaign is May. In this month 66.87% of campaigns started ended up reaching their goal. Quarter two overall follows suit with 64.53% of campaigns succeeding. Secondly, the worst month to start is December. In that month there was a success rate of 52.86%. Conclusively, if you are going to start a theater based campaign on Kickstarter do it in May and not December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
