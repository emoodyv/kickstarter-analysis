# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This research is at the behest of a play writer named Louise. She launched a campaign on Kickstarter for her play named Fever. So far that campaign has come close to its fundraising goal. Therefore, Louise wants to use data analytics in order to explore the correlation between successful projects and factors such as lunch date and fundraising goal.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze a plethora of Kickstarter projects in order to observe how well theater play fundraising campaigns fared. 

## Analysis Overview
Towards the goal of exploring the correlation between successful projects and factors such as lunch date and fundraising goal this endeavor obtained data from 4114 Kickstarter projects. Here are a few examples of what that data looked like:

In order to come to any conclusions with this data it was filtered, sorted, and parsed by multiple factors derived from the data. These included the project goal, amount pledged, outcome of the campaign, when the campaign was launched (more importantly the month it was stated), how many backers the campaign had, the parent category, subcategory, and the percentage it was funded. With all these factors several conclusions were able to be made.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One of the important conclusions that needed to be deciphered and made was how campaigns fared with respect to their month of inception. To that end, a pivot chart was created with the 4114 campaigns being filtered by the parent category and the month created. Note that for the purposes of Louiseâ€™s data aspirations the data was filtered to only include theater campaigns. Below is the resultant data:

From this data a conclusion was able to be reached.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
